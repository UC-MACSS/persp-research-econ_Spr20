# Project Proposal (10 points)

**Produce a research question and proposal for your term project using a computational social science research design**


## Elements of a project proposal

1. Clearly state a research question
    * Maybe give a few citations (not a full literature review)
    * Give a little information about why it is interesting
    * Give a little information about what your contribution will be
2. Describe how you will answer that question
    * What data will you use?
        * Maybe give a preliminary figure/plot/table
    * What theory will you use to interpret the data?
    * What analyses and computational tools will you use?
3. What do you think your answer might be?
    * What are the potential channels and alternatives?


## Proposal format

1. You should prepare a [5 minute quasi-Ignite-style presentation](http://www.ignitetalks.io/) using slides
    * Exactly **10 slides, auto-advancing every 30 seconds**
    * Use any software you want to generate the slides **as long as you include a PDF version**
    * Here is a [LaTeX slides template](https://github.com/UC-MACSS/persp-research-econ_Spr20/blob/master/templates/LaTeXslides_template.tex) you can use if you wish.
2. Push your slides to your project repository on your GitHub fork in the `Proposal` folder no later than 11:59pm Central Time (Chicago Time), Tuesday, April 14.
3. You will present your proposal with slides in class on Wednesday, April 15.


## Things to watch out for

* State your research question clearly
    * Usually a narrower scope is better
    * Title should refer to a question
* Make sure to use a computationally-enhanced research design
    * This could involve computational elements for data collection or statistical learning methods
    * This could involve running a digital survey or experiment or simulation
    * What you should not prepare - a basic OLS/logistic regression model reevaluating a commonly used observational data set. Do something more computationally cutting edge.
* **Make sure you can get the data**
* If you have a title slide, know that we will spend 30 seconds there
* Manage your time during the presentation
* Don't spend too much time on the literature
* Answer questions but don't get derailed


## How to come up with a good project

* What topic areas are you interested in?
    * Read the most current articles.
* Extend one of those papers in a small way.
    * New data
    * New population
    * Question about different part of the data
    * New/better methods
* Must use computational method more sophisticated than linear regression.
    * Can use logit if you code your own likelihood function
    * Web scraping, Mechanical Turk, structural economics (computation and/or estimation), machine learning (prediction), especially cool would be machine learning with inference.
    * Look for open source projects in your area that you can build off of.
* Talk to faculty.
