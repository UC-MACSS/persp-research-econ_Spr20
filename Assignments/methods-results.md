# Methods/Initial Results section (15 points)

**Write a methods and initial results section of your project paper**

1. Write a 4-to-8 page methods and initial results section. (See class slides for [data/methods](https://github.com/UC-MACSS/persp-research-econ_Spr20/blob/master/Slides/DataSection_slides.pdf) and [results](https://github.com/UC-MACSS/persp-research-econ_Spr20/blob/master/Slides/ResultsSection_slides.pdf).) A copy of this document (PDF) should be available in the `MethodsResults` folder of your project repository on GitHub by 11:59pm Central Time (Chicago Time) on Wednesday, May 27. You do not need to e-mail this project to Dr. Evans or the TA. We will clone your personal repository for the class (forked from the main repository) to get it.
2. Include a title page that has your title, your name, date, and an abstract that summarizes your research question and what you are doing. This will remove any need for you to have an extensive introduction or literature review. Just jump into the methods, data, and initial results. You will likely also need a references page or bibliography.
3. There are at least three ways you could organize the body this writing assignment. You could have one of the following three arrangements (I recommend the first two).
    * Data, model or methods, and results sections
    * Have a methods section and a results section
    * Have one results section in which you also describe your data and methods or model.
4. The methods and results sections answer the questions of "How did I go about answering my research question?" and "What is my evidence for the answer to my research question?"
5. You will be graded on organization and clarity, effectiveness and appropriateness of data, your description and execution of your methods, and your interpretation of results.
6. Your methods and initial results paper should have at least one table or plot (this is a very low bar).
